# Violation Bot

Violation Bot is a **for fun** Discord bot that allows users to file a violation against others. While violations can be defined differently for any Discord server, our server defines violations as:

    - Questional remarks/comments
    - "Out of pocket" remarks
    - Unfunny jokes

Once a user files for a violation, Violation Bot will then record and announce it to the whole Discord server (optionally uses the dreaded @everyone mention)
